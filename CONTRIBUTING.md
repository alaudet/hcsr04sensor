# Contributing Guidelines to __hcsr04sensor__

Contributions are welcome.

1) Please open an issue in the tracker to suggest a change or fix before issuing the pull request.  

2) All pull requests should be off of the __devel__ branch and not off the master.

3) All code submitted must be your own or be allowable to re-distribute under the MIT License.  

4) Please reasonably follow PEP8 guidelines for your code.  For example, if you create a function, give it a docstring so others know what you are doing.  Add comments to make your code clearer to others reading it. If your code is a mess it will not be included.  

5) I can't promise that all new features will be accepted.  However the MIT license allows/welcomes you to fork the code and release an altered version under any license that you like.  Please see the requirements under the MIT license when doing so.

6) Make sure your changes work before issuing the pull request.  Adding a unittest is highly encouraged.  Make sure any current unittests pass.

9) If you want to contribute we have a Discord group for Raspi-Sump which includes a channel called __#code-discussion__ and __#hcsr04sensor__.  It is not mandatory to join but highly encouraged and makes collaboration much easier.  Email alaudet@linuxnorth.org to request an invite link.
