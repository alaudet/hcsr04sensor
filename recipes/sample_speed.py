    # The default sample_size is 11 and sample_wait is 0.1
    # Increase speed by lowering the sample_size and sample_wait
    # The effect of reducing sample_size is larger variance in readings
    # The effect of lowering sample_wait is higher cpu usage and sensor
    # instability if you push it with too fast of a value.
    # These two options have been added to allow you to tweak a
    # more optimal setting for your application.

    # e.g.
    raw_measurement = value.raw_distance(sample_size=5, sample_wait=0.03)

    # Calculate the distance in centimeters
    print("The Distance = {} centimeters".format(round(raw_measurement, 1)))
